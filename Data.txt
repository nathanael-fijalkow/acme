% DESCRIPTION OF THE AUTOMATON
% FILE FORMAT LINE BY LINE
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% the first line is the size of the automaton
% size : int

% the second line is the type of the automaton
% c: classical
% p: probabilistic
% n (int): a B-automaton with n counters

% The third line is the alphabet. Each character is a letter, they should not be separated
% alphabet : string

% The fourth line is the initial states. Each state should be separated by spaces
% initial states : int Array

% The fifth line is the final states. Each state should be separated by spaces
% final states : int Array

% The next lines are the transition matrices, one for each letter in the input order.
% A transition matrix is given by actions (like IE,RI, OO, __) separated by spaces.
% Each matrix is preceded by a single character line, the letter (for readability and checking purposes). 
% transition matrices : action Array

% For classical automata (without counters), the transition matrix contains only 1 and _.
% The blank lines and lines starting with "%" are ignored
